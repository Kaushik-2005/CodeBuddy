### ReAct Cognitive Loop Implementation

The core intelligence of CodeBuddy is powered by a sophisticated **ReAct (Reason-Act-Observe-Learn)** loop:

1. **REASON**: Analyze user intent and current context using LLM-powered reasoning
2. **ACT**: Execute appropriate tools based on reasoning conclusions  
3. **OBSERVE**: Monitor results and update system state
4. **LEARN**: Extract patterns and improve future decision-making

```python
# Simplified ReAct Loop Flow
for iteration in range(max_iterations):
    reasoning = self._reason(user_input, current_state, conversation_history)
    action, result = self._act(reasoning)
    current_state = self._observe(current_state, action, result)
    lessons = self._learn(conversation_turn)
```

# Custom Tool Example
def custom_analysis_tool(filepath: str, analysis_type: str) -> str:
    """Custom tool implementation with standardized interface"""
    # Tool implementation
    return analysis_result

# Registration
agent.tool_registry.register("custom_analysis", custom_analysis_tool, {
    "category": "analysis",
    "complexity": "medium",
