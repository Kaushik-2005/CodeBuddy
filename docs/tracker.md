## Current Issues & Notes:

### ‚úÖ Resolved Issues:
- **LLM Tool Parsing**: Fixed parameter parsing for complex content
- **File Path Handling**: Resolved directory creation and path consistency
- **API Quota Management**: Added fallback mock mode for development
- **CLI Output**: Clean formatting with success/error indicators
- **Multi-file Generation**: Successfully tested with library management project
- **Context Awareness**: Implemented comprehensive memory system
- **Directory Operations**: Added safe directory deletion with protections

### üîß Known Issues:
- **LLM Output Consistency**: Occasionally generates non-tool commands (mitigated with improved prompts)
- **Complex Code Generation**: Large files may hit token limits
- **Error Recovery**: Limited automatic retry mechanisms

### üìã Next Priority:
**Code Analysis Tools** - Implement syntax validation, linting, and code quality analysis to complete Phase 2.

## Testing Status:

### ‚úÖ Completed Tests:
- Basic file operations (create, read, delete)
- Directory operations (create, delete with safety)
- Multi-file project generation 
- Directory structure operations
- Search functionality across codebase
- Error handling and recovery
- API quota exceeded scenarios
- **Memory system functionality**
- **Context-aware conversations**
- **Smart file reference resolution**

### üìã Pending Tests:
