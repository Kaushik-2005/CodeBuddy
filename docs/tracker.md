- [x] `create_directory` - Directory creation
- [x] Multi-file code generation (tested with library management system)
- [x] Proper file path handling and escaping
- [x] Clean CLI output with success/error messaging

### ‚ùå Git Tools (NOT STARTED)
- [ ] `git_status` - Show repository status
- [ ] `git_diff` - Display file differences
- [ ] `git_add` - Stage files for commit
- [ ] `git_commit` - Commit changes with messages
- [ ] `git_log` - View commit history
- [ ] `git_branch` - Branch management
- [ ] Integration with filesystem tools

### ‚ùå Code Analysis Tools (NOT STARTED)
- [ ] `run_linter` - Code quality analysis
- [ ] `find_references` - Find symbol usage
- [ ] Syntax validation for multiple languages
- [ ] Code metrics and complexity analysis
- [ ] Integration with popular linters (pylint, eslint, etc.)

### ‚ùå Execution Tools (NOT STARTED)
- [ ] `run_command` - Execute shell commands safely
- [ ] `run_tests` - Execute test suites
- [ ] Process monitoring and timeout handling
- [ ] Output capturing and formatting
- [ ] Cross-platform command execution

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Enhanced Error Handling (PARTIAL)
- [x] Rich error messaging for tools
- [x] API quota handling with mock mode fallback
- [x] File operation safety checks
- [ ] Comprehensive error recovery suggestions
- [ ] Retry mechanisms for failed operations
- [ ] User-friendly error explanations

---

## üö´ Phase 3: Safety & Recovery (NOT STARTED)
- [ ] File change preview system
- [ ] User approval workflow for destructive operations
- [ ] Git-based rollback capabilities
- [ ] Comprehensive backup system
- [ ] Safety framework for dangerous operations

---

## üö´ Phase 4: Intelligence Enhancement (NOT STARTED)
- [ ] Context awareness and memory
- [ ] Learning from user patterns
- [ ] Proactive suggestions
- [ ] Multi-step task planning
- [ ] Code understanding and analysis

---

## üö´ Phase 5: Advanced Features (NOT STARTED)
- [ ] Plugin system for extensions
- [ ] Custom tool creation
- [ ] Integration with IDEs
- [ ] Remote repository support
- [ ] Collaborative features

---

## Current Issues & Notes:

### ‚úÖ Resolved Issues:
- **LLM Tool Parsing**: Fixed parameter parsing for complex content
- **File Path Handling**: Resolved directory creation and path consistency
- **API Quota Management**: Added fallback mock mode for development
- **CLI Output**: Clean formatting with success/error indicators
- **Multi-file Generation**: Successfully tested with library management project

### üîß Known Issues:
- **LLM Output Consistency**: Occasionally generates non-tool commands (mitigated with improved prompts)
- **Complex Code Generation**: Large files may hit token limits
- **Error Recovery**: Limited automatic retry mechanisms

### üìã Next Priority:
**Git Tools Implementation** - Start with basic `git_status` and `git_diff` functionality to complete Phase 2.

---

## Testing Status:

### ‚úÖ Completed Tests:
- Basic file operations (create, read, delete)
- Multi-file project generation 
- Directory structure operations
- Search functionality across codebase
- Error handling and recovery
- API quota exceeded scenarios

### üìã Pending Tests:
- Git integration workflows
- Code analysis tools
- Command execution safety
- Large project handling
- Performance with complex codebases
