# Building Your AI Coding Agent

Welcome to an exciting journey in AI-powered development automation! This assignment challenges you to architect and build a functional AI coding agent that can understand, reason about, and modify codebases through natural language interaction. **Feel free to be as innovative and creative as you'd like** – while we provide a structured framework below, the most exceptional solutions often emerge from fresh perspectives and creative approaches.

## Your Mission

You're tasked with building a **terminal-based AI coding agent** that transforms how developers interact with their codebases. Think of this as creating an intelligent pair-programming partner that can understand context, make reasoned decisions, and execute development tasks autonomously while maintaining safety and user control.

The beauty of this challenge lies in its practical application. While we've outlined a suggested approach below, breakthrough solutions rarely follow predictable paths. Trust your engineering instincts, experiment boldly, and remember that the best tools solve real developer pain points.

## What You Need to Deliver

### 1. Functional AI Coding Agent (Most Important)

Create a **working AI agent system** that includes:

- **Core Agent Engine:** Implements the fundamental Perceive → Reason → Act → Learn loop
- **LLM Integration Layer:** Clean abstraction for interacting with language models
- **Tool Execution System:** Safe, observable way to interact with development environment
- **Terminal Interface:** Natural command-line interaction for developers
- **Safety Framework:** User approval system for destructive operations

These components should work together to create a practical coding assistant that feels like a natural extension of your development workflow.

### 2. Live Implementation Proof

- **Working Demo:** Complete system demonstration with real codebase interaction
- **Agent Architecture:** Clear documentation of your system design and components
- **Tool Implementation:** Actual tools your agent can use (file operations, git, testing, etc.)
- **Safety Mechanisms:** Implemented safeguards and user control features
- **Usage Documentation:** How other developers can use and extend your agent

**Note:** Your agent must demonstrate real functionality – mockups or theoretical implementations don't count.

## Core Agent Architecture: The Foundation

Every effective coding agent follows a fundamental pattern that you should implement:

### The Agent Loop: Perceive → Reason → Act → Learn → Repeat

This is your north star – everything else builds around this core cycle:

1. **Perceive:** Gather current state (file contents, git status, user intent)
2. **Reason:** Use LLM to analyze situation and plan actions
3. **Act:** Execute tools safely with user oversight
4. **Learn:** Update memory and context for future decisions
5. **Repeat:** Continue until task completion or user intervention

## Essential System Components

### 1. LLM Integration Layer (The Brain)

This layer handles all interactions with the language model. It should manage:

- **Prompt Engineering:** Crafting effective prompts for desired outputs
- **Response Handling:** Interpreting and structuring LLM responses
- **Context Management:** Keeping track of conversation and code context
- **Error Handling:** Managing and recovering from LLM errors

#### What you're building:
Clean abstraction over language model providers that handles the "thinking" part of your agent.

**Key architectural decisions:**
- Multi-provider support (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models)
- Structured output handling for actionable commands
- Context window management and smart truncation
- Token cost tracking and optimization

**Success criteria:**  
The brain consistently produces valid, executable actions from current state + available tools + user intent.

---

### 2. Tool Execution Engine (The Hands)

**Your goal:**  
Create a safe, observable way for the agent to interact with the development environment.

**Core tool categories to implement:**
```
Filesystem: read_file, write_file, search_codebase, get_structure  
Git Operations: status, diff, commit, branch, merge  
Code Analysis: run_linter, analyze_dependencies, find_references  
Execution: run_command, run_tests, build_project
```

**Critical design principles:**
- **Sandboxing:** All destructive operations require approval
- **Atomic operations:** Each tool call should be complete and reversible
- **Rich feedback:** Tools return results AND context about what happened
- **Error recovery:** Tools suggest fixes when they fail

---

### 3. Memory & State Management (The Memory)

**The pattern:**  
Implement both working memory (current session) and persistent memory (learned patterns).

**Working Memory:**
- Current file contents and recent changes
- Command history and results
- Active conversation context
- Error states and recovery attempts

**Persistent Memory:**
- Project-specific patterns and preferences
- User coding style and common workflows
- Historical success/failure patterns
- Tool usage effectiveness metrics

---

### 4. Terminal Interface Layer (The Interface)

**Design philosophy:** Your interface should feel like a natural extension of the terminal, not a separate application.

**Interface patterns to implement:**
- Streaming responses for long operations
- Interactive approval system for destructive changes
- Rich diffs and previews before modifications
- Configurable verbosity levels

---

## Implementation Strategy (Practical Steps)

### Phase 1: Prove the Core Loop Works

**Start here:** Build the simplest possible version that completes one full cycle.

**Your minimal viable loop:**
1. Accept natural language request
2. Generate plan using LLM
3. Execute one safe tool (like `read_file`)
4. Update internal state
5. Provide feedback to user

**Success criteria:** Ask it "What's in package.json?" and get a reasonable response.

**Why this matters:** Until you prove the basic loop works, everything else is premature optimization.

---

### Phase 2: Add Tool Sophistication

**Recommended progression:**
1. File operations (read, write, search)
2. Git operations (status, diff, simple commits)
3. Code execution (run commands, capture output)
4. Analysis tools (linting, testing)

**Key insight:** Each new tool should solve a real developer workflow, not just add capability.

---

### Phase 3: Implement Safety and Recovery

**Essential safety features:**
- Preview mode: Show what will change before doing it
- Rollback capability: Undo agent actions
- Approval workflows: Gate destructive operations
- Error explanation: When things fail, explain why and suggest fixes

---

### Phase 4: Polish and Demonstrate

**Focus areas:**
- Context efficiency and response speed
- User experience and workflow integration
- Memory optimization and pattern learning
- Comprehensive demonstration

## Technical Architecture Patterns

### The ReAct Loop Pattern

**What it is:** Reason → Act → Observe cycle that enables self-correction.

**Implementation:** After each tool execution, let the agent "observe" results and decide next actions.

**Why it matters:** This makes your agent feel intelligent rather than just following scripts.

---

### Human-in-the-Loop Design

**Core principle:** Design for guided autonomy, not full autonomy.

**Implementation strategy:**
- Default to asking permission for destructive operations
- Learn user preferences to reduce interruptions
- Always provide escape hatches for manual intervention

---

### Tool Orchestration Pattern

**When to use:** For complex multi-step operations requiring coordination.

**How it works:** Agent acts as orchestrator, breaking down tasks and delegating to specialized tools.

---

## Code Quality: SOLID Principles Application

### Single Responsibility Principle

Each component handles one aspect – LLM communication, tool execution, or user interface.

### Open/Closed Principle

Core logic should accommodate new tools and LLM providers without modification.

### Liskov Substitution Principle

Components should be replaceable with alternatives without affecting system behavior.

### Interface Segregation Principle

Prefer small, specific interfaces over large, general-purpose ones.

### Dependency Inversion Principle

Depend on abstractions, not on concretions. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.

## Suggested Technology Stack

### Core Technologies

- **Language:** Python (recommended) or Node.js for rapid development
- **LLM Integration:** OpenAI API, Anthropic Claude, or local models via Ollama
- **Terminal UI:** Rich (Python) or Ink (Node.js) for beautiful CLI interfaces
- **Memory:** SQLite + embeddings for semantic search
- **Git Integration:** GitPython or simple subprocess calls

### Optional Enhancements

- **Vector Database:** Chroma or similar for semantic codebase search
- **Containerization:** Docker for safe code execution
- **Configuration:** YAML/JSON for user preferences and tool configurations

## Example User Interactions (Inspiration)

Your agent should handle interactions like these naturally:

```
# Basic file operations
$ agent "What does this authentication module do?"
$ agent "Add error handling to the login function"
$ agent "Find all TODO comments in the codebase"

# Git operations
$ agent "Review my recent changes and suggest improvements"
$ agent "Create a commit with a good message"
$ agent "Show me what changed between feature branch and main"

# Code analysis and testing
$ agent "Run the tests and fix any failures you find"
$ agent "Check if this API endpoint has proper validation"
$ agent "Refactor this function to be more readable"

# Complex workflows
$ agent "Help me add a new user registration endpoint"
$ agent "Update the database schema and migrate existing data"
$ agent "Deploy this feature to staging environment"
```

---

## Safety and Control Framework

### Essential Safety Mechanisms

#### 1. Preview Before Action
- Show exactly what will change before making modifications
- Provide clear summaries of planned operations
- Allow users to approve, modify, or reject suggestions

#### 2. Reversible Operations
- Maintain operation history for rollback capability
- Use git effectively for change tracking
- Create automatic backups before destructive operations

#### 3. Graduated Autonomy
- Start with high user involvement, reduce over time
- Learn user preferences and trust patterns
- Provide granular control over agent permissions

Each tool should be a pure function: given inputs, produce predictable outputs with clear success/failure states.

### Context Management
Implement smart context truncation early - token limits will constrain your agent more than you expect.

### Error Handling
Build comprehensive error handling from the beginning. Your agent will fail frequently, and graceful failure is what distinguishes professional tools.

### User Feedback
Include rich logging and feedback mechanisms. Users need to understand what the agent is doing and why.
